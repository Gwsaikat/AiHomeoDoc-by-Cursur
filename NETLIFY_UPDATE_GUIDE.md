# Netlify Update Guide

## Fixing the Current Build Issues

I've fixed two issues that were causing the build to fail:

1. **Updated the Netlify Next.js Plugin**: Changed from version 4.41.3 to 5.10.0 in package.json
2. **Fixed the Suspense Boundary Issue**: Added proper Suspense boundaries around the useSearchParams hook in the auth error page

## How to Deploy These Updates

### Method 1: Through Git (Recommended)

1. **Commit the changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build issues: update plugin and add suspense boundary"
   git push
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically detect the push** and start a new build with the fixes.

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy using Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Verifying the Deployment

1. Check the deployment logs in your Netlify dashboard
2. Ensure there are no more build errors related to the plugin or useSearchParams
3. Test the auth error page to make sure it works correctly

## Future Updates

For any future updates:

1. Always push changes to your Git repository - Netlify will automatically build and deploy
2. Keep dependencies updated, especially the Netlify Next.js plugin
3. When using hooks like `useSearchParams`, always wrap them in a Suspense boundary
4. Check build logs for any errors after deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter similar errors in the future:

1. For plugin warnings, update the plugin version in package.json
2. For React hooks errors, check that they're wrapped in appropriate boundaries (Suspense for useSearchParams)
3. Clear the Netlify cache if issues persist: Go to Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Clear cache and deploy site
